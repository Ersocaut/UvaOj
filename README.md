# **Uva Oj**

This repository is a personal development of some os the Uva Oj problems.

So, to keep it within an order and easy to read it's separated by files, such as in official Uva site.

## **The "__Testing files" folder.**

This folder has some files used for understanding the behaviour of some objects and equivalents of them between languages.

## **Collaborators**

When someone helps me to solve some problem or questions I have, here will appear its git (or social media).

## **Links**
